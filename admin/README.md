## Configuration: Redirects to Main Homepage

For auth flows that should take users to your public homepage (outside the admin app), set the following env in your Vite environment:

```
VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://your-public-site-domain/
```

During local development, if this variable is not set, the dashboard will default to `http://localhost:3000/` when running on `localhost`. In production, it falls back to `/` if not configured, which points to the admin app root â€” so set `VITE_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to ensure proper logout behavior.
